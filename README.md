# Data-Reproducibility
The set of code gives the application of reading multiple excel files using python and necessary visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn libraries

There are four datasets having random values named dataset 1.csv till dataset 4.csv
Using the glob function, the code will iterate through all the documents
There are two function, Visualize() and Data_integrity(), which visualizes the datasets and check for the integrity of the dataset.
The necessary results are developed.
